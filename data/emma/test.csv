Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.  What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.  At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.  She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.  My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.  But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.  Even your satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well.

We shall only be making each other more angry.  But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.  His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.  I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.

Have not I some right to complain?

So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment.  As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes-- your attachment to my friend Harriet-- your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?-- that you have never thought seriously of her?''	``Never, madam,'' cried he, affronted in his turn:  ``never, I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.  I wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to-- Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received -- ''	He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.	Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night.	{"Person T": ["Miss_Harriet_Smith"], "Person L": ["Emma_Woodhouse"], "Person E": ["Miss_Smith"]}	``Encouragement! -- I give you encouragement!-- Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that the mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.  I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.''

I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her.  Jane desired me to do it, so I always do:  and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'-- which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.  However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much about it.  But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard.  If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry.  The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know.  He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time.  Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.''	{"Person C": ["Miss_Jane_Bates"], "Person Z": ["Miss_Jane_Fairfax"], "Person X": ["Mrs_Campbell"], "Person Q": ["Mrs_Bates"], "Person T": ["Mrs_Dixon"]}	``Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since.
