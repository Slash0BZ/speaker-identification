On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.  Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.  Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.''	``You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.  He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him desperate.''	She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	{"Person T": ["Jane Bennet"], "Person J": ["Mr. Bingley"], "Person F": ["Elizabeth Bennet"], "Person Y": ["Lady Anne Darcy"], "Person B": ["Mr. Wickham"], "Person Q": ["Mr. Darcy"]}	The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.  She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.  ``And then,'' said she, ``if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!''

You are not well enough; -- you cannot go yourself.''	Person Z	Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows -- it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first: ``By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.  Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.  All that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the London road.  I know not what to think.  After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success; no such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.  Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing? -- Impossible.  I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.  Adieu.  I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.  In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.''	``Oh!  where, where is my uncle?'' cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.

But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.''	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: ``I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.  But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly as to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will go round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the world.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.  Your's, &c.''	Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	{"Person Q": ["Lady Catherine"], "Person K": ["Elizabeth Bennet"], "Person D": ["Mr. Bingley"], "Person Z": ["Lydia Bennet"]}	``And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.
